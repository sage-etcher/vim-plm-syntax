# PL/M Syntax Highlighting for Vim

Vim Syntax Highlighting for the PL/M Programming Language.

[PL/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/M), Programming Language for Micro-Proccessor Computers, is a programming language developped by [Gary Kildall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kildall) in 1973 for the [intel 8008 micro-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8008). The language itself was based off the practices of various before it, namely: [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I), [ALGOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol), and [XPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPL). Gary Kildall later went on to write the [CP/M operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M), utilizing the language to write much of the code for the operating system.

PL/M is often creditted as being the first High-Level Language written specifically for micro-computers.

## Examples

Vim (and the vast majority of modern code edittors) lacks propper syntax highlighting for the language, due to it's age. So, rather than being condemned to having to edit files in plain text, you can get basic syntax highlighting here!
